# Add Two Numbers

Original Problem: [LeetCode - Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

**You can check the solutions in different programming languages [here](https://github.com/arthur404dev/leetcode-02-add-two-numbers/tree/main/solutions).**

## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

![example-1](./assets/addtwonumber1.jpg)

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute a soultion in another programming language, feel free to create a Pull Request following the convention:

1. Files should be named with the pattern: `[language-name]-solution.[language-extension]`

    *E.g: For a golang submission the name should be either: `go-solution.go` or `golang-solution.go`*

2. Branches should be named using the pattern: `feat:[language-name]-solution`

    *E.g: For a golang submission the name of the branch should be: `feat:golang-solution`*

3. Feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/arthur404dev/leetcode-02-add-two-numbers/issues) section as a discussion forum for each topic.
